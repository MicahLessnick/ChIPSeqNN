# ChIPSeqNN
Project files for a neural net classifier of ChIP-Seq datasets

Project description: this project was first developed as part of the Ford Scholarship Program through Eckerd College. It consists of a classifier to identify true peaks and false positives in a ChIP-Seq dataset as well as various other auxiliary files for data processing and a UI

R script: used for preprocessing of the dataset (labeling training data, normalizing dataset, graphing features, etc...). Script is built to utilize local path names. In order for it to work on other computers, file names and paths must be changed
